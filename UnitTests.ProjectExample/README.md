# Unit Test-Examples


# Notes:
1. For running our unit tests we have more than a option (externarl runner, resharper, etc)
	- For external go to: https://github.com/NUnitSoftware/nunit-gui/releases and download nunit-gui, you can open the test dll. This is going to be loaded by reflection.
	- With Visual Studio plugin go to: https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/releases and add to visual studio.
	- With Visual Studio find test explorer. You will have a UI for this purpose.
